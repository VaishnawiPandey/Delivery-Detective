Yet today there is only oneâhomo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us?Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, Sapiens integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas.Dr. Harari also compels us to look ahead, because over the last few decades humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have governed life for the past four billion years. We are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us, but also ourselves. Where is this leading us, and what do we want to become?Featuring 27 photographs, 6 maps, and 25 illustrations/diagrams, this provocative and insightful work is sure to spark debate and is essential reading for aficionados of Jared Diamond, James Gleick, Matt Ridley, Robert Wright, and Sharon Moalem. ...more",Five,68ef4e1c88a342b2917d3ac3,"From a renowned historian comes a groundbreaking narrative of humanityâs creation and evolutionâa #1 international bestsellerâthat explores the ways in which biology and history have defined us and enhanced our understanding of what it means to be âhuman.âOne hundred thousand years ago, at least six different species of humans inhabited Earth.

This book takes you back with a breathtaking, present-tense bird's eye view into a time when women's liberation was primarily confined to one woman's very capable, independent mind. I couldn't put it down.""---Ruth Buzzi, Golden Globe Award winner and Television Hall of Fame inductee""Sadly, too many Americans have never heard of Victoria Woodhull, let alone learned of her story: her revolutionary campaign for the presidency at a time when women weren't even allowed to vote, her support for worker's rights, or her feminist commitment to equality, a century before the official battle over the Equal Rights Amendment. But in The Coming Woman, Karen Hicks brings Woodhull's efforts to life, and reminds us that some of our nation's greatest figures aren't always featured in the history books. It is a riveting account of an amazing woman and her struggle for justice and human dignity, told in an engaging and eminently readable style.""-Tim Wise, author, ""White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son""""The Coming Woman"" is a novel based on the life of feminist Victoria Woodhull, the first woman to run for U.S. President, 50 years before women could even vote!Running for President wasn't Victoria's only first as a woman. She was also the first to own a successful Wall Street firm, the first to publish a successful national newspaper, and the first to head the two-million-member Spiritualist Association. She was the first woman to enter the Senate Judiciary Committee chambers to petition for woman's suffrage, her argument changing the entire focus of the suffragist movement by pointing out that the 14th and 15th Amendments already gave women the vote.In her campaign for the Presidency, Victoria Woodhull boldly addressed many of the issues we still face today: equal pay for equal work; freedom in love; corporate greed and political corruption fueled by powerful lobbyists; and the increasing disparity between the rich and the poor, to name only a few. Her outspoken and common-sense ideas may shed a new perspective on the parallel conundrums of today's world.This bold, beautiful, and sexually progressive woman dared to take on society and religion. To make an example of the hypocrisy in what Mark Twain dubbed The Gilded Age, she exposed the extramarital affairs of the most popular religious figure of the day (Henry Ward Beecher). This led to her persecution and imprisonment and the longest, most infamous trial of the 19th century. But it did not stop her fight for equality.Victoria's epic story, set in the late 1800s, comes to life in a modern, fictional style, while staying true to the actual words and views of the many well-known characters. ...more",Three,68ef4e1e88a342b2917d3ac6,"""If you have a heart, if you have a soul, Karen Hicks' The Coming Woman will make you fall in love with Victoria Woodhull.""-Kinky Friedman, author and Governor of the Heart of Texas ""What kind of confidence would it take for a woman to buck the old boy's club of politics in 1872?

The Boys in the Boat: Nine Americans and Their Epic Quest for Gold at the 1936 Berlin Olympics,"For readers of Laura Hillenbrand's Seabiscuit and Unbroken, the dramatic story of the American rowing team that stunned the world at Hitler's 1936 Berlin Olympics Daniel James Brownâs robust book tells the story of the University of Washingtonâs 1936 eight-oar crew and their epic quest for an Olympic gold medal, a team that transformed the sport and grabbed the attention o For readers of Laura Hillenbrand's Seabiscuit and Unbroken, the dramatic story of the American rowing team that stunned the world at Hitler's 1936 Berlin Olympics Daniel James Brownâs robust book tells the story of the University of Washingtonâs 1936 eight-oar crew and their epic quest for an Olympic gold medal, a team that transformed the sport and grabbed the attention of millions of Americans. The sons of loggers, shipyard workers, and farmers, the boys defeated elite rivals first from eastern and British universities and finally the German crew rowing for Adolf Hitler in the Olympic games in Berlin, 1936. The emotional heart of the story lies with one rower, Joe Rantz, a teenager without family or prospects, who rows not for glory, but to regain his shattered self-regard and to find a place he can call home. The crew is assembledÂ  by an enigmatic coach and mentored by a visionary, eccentric British boat builder, but it is their trust in each other that makes them a victorious team. They remind the country of what can be done when everyone quite literally pulls togetherâa perfect melding of commitment, determination, and optimism. Drawing on the boysâ own diaries and journals, their photos and memories of a once-in-a-lifetime shared dream, The Boys in the Boat is an irresistible story about beating the odds and finding hope in the most desperate of timesâthe improbable, intimate story of nine working-class boys from the American west who, in the depths of the Great Depression, showed the world what true grit really meant. It will appeal to readers of Erik Larson, Timothy Egan, James Bradley, and David Halberstam's The Amateurs. ...more",Four,68ef4e1f88a342b2917d3ac7,"For readers of Laura Hillenbrand's Seabiscuit and Unbroken, the dramatic story of the American rowing team that stunned the world at Hitler's 1936 Berlin Olympics Daniel James Brownâs robust book tells the story of the University of Washingtonâs 1936 eight-oar crew and their epic quest for an Olympic gold medal, a team that transformed the sport and grabbed the attention o For readers of Laura Hillenbrand's Seabiscuit and Unbroken, the dramatic story of the American rowing team that stunned the world at Hitler's 1936 Berlin Olympics Daniel James Brownâs robust book tells the story of the University of Washingtonâs 1936 eight-oar crew and their epic quest for an Olympic gold medal, a team that transformed the sport and grabbed the attention of millions of Americans.

They will live in an apartment on campus with Charlie, a young chimp abandoned by his mother. The Freemans were selected for the experiment because they know sign language; they are supposed to teach it to Charlie and welcome him as a member of their family. Isolated in their new, nearly all-white community not just by their race but by their strange living situation, the Freemans come undone. And when Charlotte discovers the truth about the Instituteâs history of questionable studies, the secrets of the past begin to invade the present. The power of this novel resides in Kaitlyn Greenidgeâs undeniable storytelling talents. What appears to be a story of mothers and daughters, of sisterhood put to the test, of adolescent love and grown-up misconduct, and of historyâs long reach, becomes a provocative and compelling exploration of Americaâs failure to find a language to talk about race. ...more",Five,68ef4e4b88a342b2917d3aed,"The Freeman family--Charles, Laurel, and their daughters, teenage Charlotte and nine-year-old Callie--have been invited to the Toneybee Institute in rural Massachusetts to participate in a research experiment.

They are the only family she has, aside from her paternal grandmother Dorothy, so when her uncle dies from the attack and her father lays comatose in ICU, it falls to Andrea to not only investigate who would want to kill her father and uncle, but also to oversee Harding Industries, the family company. When her fatherâs longtime attorney and one of a handful of family friends, Beth Cowling, rushes to help Andrea long distance, the youngest Harding soon finds herself surrounded by a bevy of intriguing new friends and helpers. First to arrive is Bethâs own daughter, Riva, acting as Andreaâs attorney after Andrea is violently attacked in her fatherâs home, where she grew up, forcing her to kill both would-be assassins. When Nicholasâs on again/off again lover, state prosecutor and gubernatorial hopeful Kerry Marcus, is equally at a loss to name suspects in the Harding family attacks, Riva begins her own investigation into the short list of family friends and colleagues, including Don Marshall, former colleague of Nicholasâs at Marshall Pharmaceutical, which Don now runs, and Donâs wife Karen. Marshall has a shady past, including an incident at his company that also involved Andreaâs father. She also looks closely at Marcus Ricci, father of Andreaâs closest high school friend, Jason. After Jasonâs death from leukemia, Ricci becomes like a second father to Andrea. Ricci is also widely believed to have ties to the New Jersey mob. But Beth has another contact she wants involved in the investigation, Deirdre Southington, daughter of Bethâs old friend Cordelia Southington. The Southington family has more money than God, as well as, through Deirdre, more contacts in the intriguing world of international espionage. A former NSA agent, Deirdre is mysterious and beautiful in a cold way.

They are the only family she has, aside from her paternal grandmother Dorothy, so when her uncle dies from the attack and her father lays comatose in ICU, it falls to Andrea to not only investigate who would want to kill her father and uncle, but also to oversee Harding Industries, the family company. When her fatherâs longtime attorney and one of a handful of family friends, Beth Cowling, rushes to help Andrea long distance, the youngest Harding soon finds herself surrounded by a bevy of intriguing new friends and helpers. First to arrive is Bethâs own daughter, Riva, acting as Andreaâs attorney after Andrea is violently attacked in her fatherâs home, where she grew up, forcing her to kill both would-be assassins. When Nicholasâs on again/off again lover, state prosecutor and gubernatorial hopeful Kerry Marcus, is equally at a loss to name suspects in the Harding family attacks, Riva begins her own investigation into the short list of family friends and colleagues, including Don Marshall, former colleague of Nicholasâs at Marshall Pharmaceutical, which Don now runs, and Donâs wife Karen. Marshall has a shady past, including an incident at his company that also involved Andreaâs father. She also looks closely at Marcus Ricci, father of Andreaâs closest high school friend, Jason. After Jasonâs death from leukemia, Ricci becomes like a second father to Andrea. Ricci is also widely believed to have ties to the New Jersey mob. But Beth has another contact she wants involved in the investigation, Deirdre Southington, daughter of Bethâs old friend Cordelia Southington. The Southington family has more money than God, as well as, through Deirdre, more contacts in the intriguing world of international espionage. A former NSA agent, Deirdre is mysterious and beautiful in a cold way. An eccentric who travels via private rail car, she is also extraordinarily persuasive, holding a PhD in forensic psychology that she has put to great use in both her work with the NSA and on her own, as a defender of good, rooting out evil doers and ensuring they are brought to her own brand of justice.

The Most Perfect Thing: Inside (and Outside) a Bird's Egg,"Renowned ornithologist Tim Birkhead opens this gripping story as a female guillemot chick hatches, already carrying her full quota of tiny eggs within her undeveloped ovary. As she grows into adulthood, only a few of her eggs mature, are released into the oviduct, and are fertilized by sperm stored from copulation that took place days or weeks earlier. Within a matter of h Renowned ornithologist Tim Birkhead opens this gripping story as a female guillemot chick hatches, already carrying her full quota of tiny eggs within her undeveloped ovary. As she grows into adulthood, only a few of her eggs mature, are released into the oviduct, and are fertilized by sperm stored from copulation that took place days or weeks earlier. Within a matter of hours, the fragile yolk is surrounded by albumen and the whole is gradually encased within a turquoise jewel of a shell. Soon afterward the fully formed egg is expelled onto a bare rocky ledge, where it will be incubated for four weeks before another chick emerges and the life cycle begins again. A Bird's Egg is about how eggs in general are made, fertilized, developed, and hatched. The eggs of most birds spend just 24 hours in the oviduct; however, that journey takes 48 hours in cuckoos, which surreptitiously lay their eggs in the nests of other birds. From the earliest times, the study of birds' ovaries and ova (eggs) played a vital role in the quest to unravel the mysteries of fertilization and embryo development in humans. Birkhead uses birds' eggs as wondrous portals into natural history, enlivened by the stories of naturalists and scientists, including Birkhead and his students, whose discoveries have advanced current scientific knowledge of reproduction. ...more",Four,68ef4e5e88a342b2917d3afd,"Renowned ornithologist Tim Birkhead opens this gripping story as a female guillemot chick hatches, already carrying her full quota of tiny eggs within her undeveloped ovary.

"Pop Gun War, Volume 1: Gift","""Pop Gun War is about childhood, self-discovery, oppression, guilt, dreams, loneliness, whatever. It is more about a feeling you, the reader, get from the story rather than a typical narrative. If you wanted to get literal, it is about an inner city boy, Sinclair, who discovers a pair of discarded angel wings.

If you wanted to get literal, it is about an inner city boy, Sinclair, who discovers a pair of discarded angel wings. With these wings, Sinclair flies around the city and gets into adventures."" - Farel Dalrymple, series creator From Publishers Weekly: Collecting the first five issues of Dalrymple's acclaimed comic book series Pop Gun War, this book provides a capsule look at Dalrymple's vision of urban fantasy. Set in New York, his stories follow characters with wings, talking fish, giants, dwarves and other fantastical acquaintances and ideas. At the center of it all is a boy named Sinclair, who acquires a set of wings when a tattooed, disgruntled angel pays to have them cut off. Sinclair, a lonely kid prone to bowties and being teased, sets off on a series of encounters across the city. His older sister, a singer in a rock band, is an inspiration and worry; a homeless man of unknown powers and origins joins him; and a band of youths pursue him. Dalrymple renders this gang of eccentrics and mystics in a loose but realistic pen and ink style highly dynamic and tailor-made for depicting New York's teeming city streets. He has a flair for the dramatic as well scenes of Sinclair flying, or of a giant walking the streets, are genuinely affecting, while seeming completely natural and brings to life a subtle kind of cartoon surrealism. The story meanders a bit, and it's not always clear where it's headed, but the fun of Pop Gun War is in its vivid characters and details. It is a fine debut, reminiscent of DC Comics's Vertigo line, with which it should sit comfortably on bookstores' and adventurous readers' shelves. ...more",One,68ef4e7488a342b2917d3b11,"""Pop Gun War is about childhood, self-discovery, oppression, guilt, dreams, loneliness, whatever.

"Don't Be a Jerk: And Other Practical Advice from Dogen, Japan's Greatest Zen Master","A Radical but Reverent Paraphrasing of Dogenâs Treasury of the True Dharma EyeâEven if the whole universe is nothing but a bunch of jerks doing all kinds of jerk-type things, there is still liberation in simply not being a jerk.â â Eihei Dogen (1200â1253 CE)The Shobogenzo (The Treasury of the True Dharma Eye) is a revered eight-hundred-year-old Zen Buddhism classic written A Radical but Reverent Paraphrasing of Dogenâs Treasury of the True Dharma EyeâEven if the whole universe is nothing but a bunch of jerks doing all kinds of jerk-type things, there is still liberation in simply not being a jerk.â â Eihei Dogen (1200â1253 CE)The Shobogenzo (The Treasury of the True Dharma Eye) is a revered eight-hundred-year-old Zen Buddhism classic written by the Japanese monk Eihei Dogen. Despite the timeless wisdom of his teachings, many consider the book difficult to understand and daunting to read. In Donât Be a Jerk, Zen priest and bestselling author Brad Warner, through accessible paraphrasing and incisive commentary, applies Dogenâs teachings to modern times. While entertaining and sometimes irreverent, Warner is also an astute scholar who sees in Dogen very modern psychological concepts, as well as insights on such topics as feminism and reincarnation.

While entertaining and sometimes irreverent, Warner is also an astute scholar who sees in Dogen very modern psychological concepts, as well as insights on such topics as feminism and reincarnation.

How A fascinating exploration of how insights from computer algorithms can be applied to our everyday lives, helping to solve common decision-making problems and illuminate the workings of the human mindAll our lives are constrained by limited space and time, limits that give rise to a particular set of problems. What should we do, or leave undone, in a day or a lifetime? How much messiness should we accept? What balance of new activities and familiar favorites is the most fulfilling? These may seem like uniquely human quandaries, but they are not: computers, too, face the same constraints, so computer scientists have been grappling with their version of such issues for decades. And the solutions they've found have much to teach us.In a dazzlingly interdisciplinary work, acclaimed author Brian Christian and cognitive scientist Tom Griffiths show how the algorithms used by computers can also untangle very human questions. They explain how to have better hunches and when to leave things to chance, how to deal with overwhelming choices and how best to connect with others.

(Un)Qualified: How God Uses Broken People to Do Big Things,"Who You Think You Are is Not as Important as Who God Says You AreMany of us wrestle with the gap between our weaknesses and our dreams, between who we are and who God says we are meant to be. We feel unqualified to do Godâs work or to live out the calling we imagine. But God has a way of using our weaknesses for good. In fact, God loves unqualified people.In (Un)Qualified, Who You Think You Are is Not as Important as Who God Says You AreMany of us wrestle with the gap between our weaknesses and our dreams, between who we are and who God says we are meant to be. We feel unqualified to do Godâs work or to live out the calling we imagine. But God has a way of using our weaknesses for good. In fact, God loves unqualified people.In (Un)Qualified, Pastor Steven Furtick helps you peel back the assumptions youâve made about yourself and see yourself as God sees you. Because true peace and confidence come not from worldly perfection but from acceptance: Godâs acceptance of you, your acceptance of yourself, and your acceptance of Godâs process of change.This is a book about understanding your identity in light of who God is. Itâs a book about coming to terms with the good, the bad, and the unmentionable in your life and learning to let God use you. Itâs about charging into the gap between your present and your hopes and meeting God there. After all, God canât bless who you pretend to be. But he longs to bless who you really are; a flawed and broken person. Good thing for us that God is in the business of using broken people to do big things. Being Unqualified Is Godâs Favorite QualificationOur culture tells us that the answer to our failures is to fix them. The solution to our weaknesses is to hide them. The secret to our success is to appear as flawless as possible. But Godâs qualifying system is different than the worldâs. So is his view of our weaknesses, our purpose, and our true selves.In (Un)Qualified, Steven Furtick explores who God is as the great âI AM,â and then helps us discover our own identity. Delving into the story of Jacob, Furtick invites us to acknowledge our weaknesses and ask God to work through them.The truth is, God has created us to be more, to accomplish more, and to love life more than we ever thought possible. But to become who he has called us to be, we must embrace who we are right now. (Un)Qualified equips us to face obstacles and failures without losing a sense of purpose. We can have a thriving sense of hope that God is working in us and through us, not in spite of our weaknesses but often as a direct result of them. ...more",Five,68ef4ea888a342b2917d3b3e,"Who You Think You Are is Not as Important as Who God Says You AreMany of us wrestle with the gap between our weaknesses and our dreams, between who we are and who God says we are meant to be.

Itâs a book about coming to terms with the good, the bad, and the unmentionable in your life and learning to let God use you. Itâs about charging into the gap between your present and your hopes and meeting God there. After all, God canât bless who you pretend to be. But he longs to bless who you really are; a flawed and broken person. Good thing for us that God is in the business of using broken people to do big things. Being Unqualified Is Godâs Favorite QualificationOur culture tells us that the answer to our failures is to fix them. The solution to our weaknesses is to hide them. The secret to our success is to appear as flawless as possible. But Godâs qualifying system is different than the worldâs. So is his view of our weaknesses, our purpose, and our true selves.In (Un)Qualified, Steven Furtick explores who God is as the great âI AM,â and then helps us discover our own identity. Delving into the story of Jacob, Furtick invites us to acknowledge our weaknesses and ask God to work through them.The truth is, God has created us to be more, to accomplish more, and to love life more than we ever thought possible. But to become who he has called us to be, we must embrace who we are right now. (Un)Qualified equips us to face obstacles and failures without losing a sense of purpose. We can have a thriving sense of hope that God is working in us and through us, not in spite of our weaknesses but often as a direct result of them. ...more",,,think important god say aremany u wrestle gap weakness dream god say meant feel unqualified godâs work live calling imagine god way using weakness good fact god love unqualified peoplein unqualified think important god say aremany u wrestle gap weakness dream god say meant feel unqualified godâs work live calling imagine god way using weakness good fact god love unqualified peoplein unqualified pastor steven furtick help peel back assumption youâve made see god see true peace confidence come worldly perfection acceptance godâs acceptance acceptance acceptance godâs process changethis book understanding identity light god itâs book coming term good bad unmentionable life learning let god use itâs charging gap present hope meeting god god canât bless pretend longs bless really flawed broken person good thing u god business using broken people big thing unqualified godâs favorite qualificationour culture tell u answer failure fix solution weakness hide secret success appear flawless possible godâs qualifying system different worldâs view weakness purpose true selvesin unqualified steven furtick explores god great âi amâ help u discover identity delving story jacob furtick invite u acknowledge weakness ask god work themthe truth god created u accomplish love life ever thought possible become called u must embrace right unqualified equips u face obstacle failure without losing sense purpose thriving sense hope god working u u spite weakness often direct result,Positive,0.1947002492457037,0,0.9805340633879377

He explains that worship is the ""imagination station"" that incubates our loves and longings so that our cultural endeavors are indexed toward God and his kingdom. This is why the church and worshiping in a local community of believers should be the hub and heart of Christian formation and discipleship.Following the publication of his influential work Desiring the Kingdom, Smith received numerous requests from pastors and leaders for a more accessible version of that book's content.

Thomas Jefferson and the Tripoli Pirates: The Forgotten War That Changed American History,"From the authors of the New York Times bestseller George Washingtonâs Secret Six ,the little-known story of Thomas Jeffersonâs battle to defend America against Islamic pirates. Brian Kilmeade â cohost of âFox & Friendsâ on Fox News and the national radio show âKilmeade & Friendsâ â returns with another fascinating historical narrative, co-written with Don Yaeger. From the authors of theÂ  New York Times Â bestsellerÂ  George Washingtonâs Secret Six ,Â the little-known story of Thomas Jeffersonâs battle to defend America against Islamic pirates. Brian Kilmeade â cohost of âFox & Friendsâ on Fox News and the national radio show âKilmeade & Friendsâ â returns with another fascinating historical narrative, co-written with Don Yaeger. Like their acclaimed bestseller George Washington's Secret Six, Thomas Jefferson and the Tripoli Pirates sheds new light on a vitally important episode that has been forgotten by most Americans. Â  Only weeks after President Jefferson's inauguration in 1801, he decided to confront the Tripoli pirates who had been kidnapping American ships and sailors, among other outrageous acts. Though inclined toward diplomacy, Jefferson sent warships to blockade Tripoli and protect American shipping, and then escalated to all-out war against the Barbary states. Â  The tiny American flotillaâwith three frigates representing half of the U.S. Navyâs top-of-the-line shipsâhad some success in blockading the Barbary coast. But that success came to an end when the USSÂ PhiladelphiaÂ ran aground in Tripoli harbor and was captured. Kilmeade and Yaeger recount the dramatic story of a young American sailor, Stephen Decatur, who snuck into the harbor, boarded theÂ Philadelphia,Â and set her on fire before escaping amid a torrent of enemy gunfire. Â  Another amazing story is that of William Eatonâs daring attack on the port city of Derna. He led a detachment of Marines on a 500-mile trek across the desert to surprise the port. His strategy worked, and an American flag was raised in victory on foreign soil for the first time. Â  Â  Few remember Decatur and Eaton today, but their legacy inspired the opening of theÂ Marine Corps Hymn: âFrom the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli, we fight our countryâs battles in the air, on land, and sea.âÂ Thomas Jefferson and the Tripoli Pirates tells a dramatic story of bravery, diplomacy, and battle on the high seas, and honors some of Americaâs forgotten heroes.Â  ...more",One,68ef4ead88a342b2917d3b44,"From the authors of the New York Times bestseller George Washingtonâs Secret Six ,the little-known story of Thomas Jeffersonâs battle to defend America against Islamic pirates.

The Third Wave: An Entrepreneurâs Vision of the Future,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLERWALL STREET JOURNAL BESTSELLEROne of Americaâs most accomplished entrepreneursâa pioneer who made the Internet part of everyday life and orchestrated the largest merger in the history of businessâshares a roadmap for how anyone can succeed in a world of rapidly changing technology.Steve Caseâs career began when he cofounded America Online (AOL) in NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLERWALL STREET JOURNAL BESTSELLEROne of Americaâs most accomplished entrepreneursâa pioneer who made the Internet part of everyday life and orchestrated the largest merger in the history of businessâshares a roadmap for how anyone can succeed in a world of rapidly changing technology.Steve Caseâs career began when he cofounded America Online (AOL) in 1985. At the time, only three percent of Americans were online. It took a decade for AOL to achieve mainstream success, and there were many near-death experiences and back-to-the-wall pivots. AOL became the top performing company of the 1990s, and at its peak more than half of all consumer Internet traffic in the United States ran through the service. After Case engineered AOLâs merger with Time Warner and he became Chairman of the combined business, Case oversaw the biggest media and communications empire in the world. In The Third Wave, which pays homage to the work of the futurist Alvin Toffler (from whom Case has borrowed the title, and whose work inspired him as a young man), Case takes us behind the scenes of some of the most consequential and riveting business decisions of our time while offering illuminating insights from decades of working as an entrepreneur, an investor, a philanthropist, and an advocate for sensible bipartisan policies. We are entering, as Case explains, a new paradigm called the âThird Waveâ of the Internet. The first wave saw AOL and other companies lay the foundation for consumers to connect to the Internet. The second wave saw companies like Google and Facebook build on top of the Internet to create search and social networking capabilities, while apps like Snapchat and Instagram leverage the smartphone revolution. Now, Case argues, weâre entering the Third Wave: a period in which entrepreneurs will vastly transform major âreal worldâ sectors like health, education, transportation, energy, and foodâand in the process change the way we live our daily lives. But success in the Third Wave will require a different skill set, and Case outlines the path forward.The Third Wave is part memoir, part manifesto, and part playbook for the future. With passion and clarity, Case explains the ways in which newly emerging technology companies (a growing number of which, he argues, will not be based in Silicon Valley) will have to rethink their relationships with customers, with competitors, and with governments; and offers advice for how entrepreneurs can make winning business decisions and strategiesâand how all of us can make sense of this changing digital age. ...more",Five,68ef4eb288a342b2917d3b49,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLERWALL STREET JOURNAL BESTSELLEROne of Americaâs most accomplished entrepreneursâa pioneer who made the Internet part of everyday life and orchestrated the largest merger in the history of businessâshares a roadmap for how anyone can succeed in a world of rapidly changing technology.Steve Caseâs career began when he cofounded America Online (AOL) in NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLERWALL STREET JOURNAL BESTSELLEROne of Americaâs most accomplished entrepreneursâa pioneer who made the Internet part of everyday life and orchestrated the largest merger in the history of businessâshares a roadmap for how anyone can succeed in a world of rapidly changing technology.Steve Caseâs career began when he cofounded America Online (AOL) in 1985.

The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals,"What should we have for dinner?"" To one degree or another this simple question assails any creature faced with a wide choice of things to eat. Anthropologists call it the omnivore's dilemma. Choosing from among the countless potential foods nature offers, humans have had to learn what is safe, and what isn'tâwhich mushrooms should be avoided, for example, and which berries What should we have for dinner?"" To one degree or another this simple question assails any creature faced with a wide choice of things to eat. Anthropologists call it the omnivore's dilemma. Choosing from among the countless potential foods nature offers, humans have had to learn what is safe, and what isn'tâwhich mushrooms should be avoided, for example, and which berries we can enjoy. Today, as America confronts what can only be described as a national eating disorder, the omnivore's dilemma has returned with an atavistic vengeance. The cornucopia of the modern American supermarket and fast-food outlet has thrown us back on a bewildering landscape where we once again have to worry about which of those tasty-looking morsels might kill us. At the same time we're realizing that our food choices also have profound implications for the health of our environment. The Omnivore's Dilemma is bestselling author Michael Pollan's brilliant and eye-opening exploration of these little-known but vitally important dimensions of eating in America. Pollan has divided The Omnivore's Dilemma into three parts, one for each of the food chains that sustain us: industrialized food, alternative or ""organic"" food, and food people obtain by dint of their own hunting, gathering, or gardening. Pollan follows each food chain literally from the ground up to the table, emphasizing our dynamic coevolutionary relationship with the species we depend on. He concludes each section by sitting down to a mealâat McDonald's, at home with his family sharing a dinner from Whole Foods, and in a revolutionary ""beyond organic"" farm in Virginia. For each meal he traces the provenance of everything consumed, revealing the hidden components we unwittingly ingest and explaining how our taste for particular foods reflects our environmental and biological inheritance. We are indeed what we eat-and what we eat remakes the world. A society of voracious and increasingly confused omnivores, we are just beginning to recognize the profound consequences of the simplest everyday food choices, both for ourselves and for the natural world. The Omnivore's Dilemma is a long-overdue book and one that will become known for bringing a completely fresh perspective to a question as ordinary and yet momentous as What shall we have for dinner?A few facts and figures from The Omnivore's Dilemma:Of the 38 ingredients it takes to make a McNugget, there are at least 13 that are derived from corn. 45 different menu items at Mcdonaldâs are made from corn. One in every three American children eats fast food every day. One in every five American meals today is eaten in the car. The food industry burns nearly a fifth of all the petroleum consumed in the United Statesâmore than we burn with our cars and more than any other industry consumes. It takes ten calories of fossil fuel energy to deliver one calorie of food energy to an American plate. A single strawberry contains about five calories. To get that strawberry from a field in California to a plate on the east coast requires 435 calories of energy. Industrial fertilizer and industrial pesticides both owe their existence to the conversion of the World War II munitions industry to civilian usesânerve gases became pesticides, and ammonium nitrate explosives became nitrogen fertilizers. ... ...more",Two,68ef4ebd88a342b2917d3b51,"What should we have for dinner?""

The Long Shadow of Small Ghosts: Murder and Memory in an American City,"In Cold Blood meets Adrian Nicole LeBlancâs Random Family: A harrowing, profoundly personal investigation of the causes, effects, and communal toll of a deeply troubling crimeâthe brutal murder of three young children by their parents in the border city of Brownsville, Texas.On March 11, 2003, in Brownsville, Texasâone of Americaâs poorest citiesâJohn Allen Rubio and Angel In Cold Blood meets Adrian Nicole LeBlancâs Random Family: A harrowing, profoundly personal investigation of the causes, effects, and communal toll of a deeply troubling crimeâthe brutal murder of three young children by their parents in the border city of Brownsville, Texas.On March 11, 2003, in Brownsville, Texasâone of Americaâs poorest citiesâJohn Allen Rubio and Angela Camacho murdered their three young children. The apartment building in which the brutal crimes took place was already rundown, and in their aftermath a consensus developed in the community that it should be destroyed. It was a place, neighbors felt, that was plagued by spiritual cancer. In 2008, journalist Laura Tillman covered the story for The Brownsville Herald. The questions it raised haunted her, particularly one asked by the sole member of the cityâs Heritage Council to oppose demolition: is there any such thing as an evil building? Her investigation took her far beyond that question, revealing the nature of the toll that the crime exacted on a city already wracked with poverty. It sprawled into a six-year inquiry into the larger significance of such acts, ones so difficult to imagine or explain that their perpetrators are often dismissed as monsters alien to humanity. With meticulous attention and stunning compassion, Tillman surveyed those surrounding the crimes, speaking with the lawyers who tried the case, the familyâs neighbors and relatives and teachers, even one of the murderers: John Allen Rubio himself, whom she corresponded with for years and ultimately met in person. The result is a brilliant exploration of some of our ageâs most important social issues, from poverty to mental illness to the death penalty, and a beautiful, profound meditation on the truly human forces that drive them. It is disturbing, insightful, and mesmerizing in equal measure. ...more",One,68ef4ec288a342b2917d3b57,"In Cold Blood meets Adrian Nicole LeBlancâs Random Family: A harrowing, profoundly personal investigation of the causes, effects, and communal toll of a deeply troubling crimeâthe brutal murder of three young children by their parents in the border city of Brownsville, Texas.On March 11, 2003, in Brownsville, Texasâone of Americaâs poorest citiesâJohn Allen Rubio and Angel In Cold Blood meets Adrian Nicole LeBlancâs Random Family: A harrowing, profoundly personal investigation of the causes, effects, and communal toll of a deeply troubling crimeâthe brutal murder of three young children by their parents in the border city of Brownsville, Texas.On March 11, 2003, in Brownsville, Texasâone of Americaâs poorest citiesâJohn Allen Rubio and Angela Camacho murdered their three young children.

The Genius of Birds,"Birds are astonishingly intelligent creatures. In fact, according to revolutionary new research, some birds rival primates and even humans in their remarkable forms of intelligence. Like humans, many birds have enormous brains relative to their size. Although small, bird brains are packed with neurons that allow them to punch well above their weight. InThe Genius of Birds, Birds are astonishingly intelligent creatures. In fact, according to revolutionary new research, some birds rival primates and even humans in their remarkable forms of intelligence.Â  Like humans, many birds have enormous brains relative to their size. Although small, bird brains are packed with neurons that allow them to punch well above their weight. InÂ The Genius of Birds, acclaimed author Jennifer Ackerman explores the newly discovered brilliance of birds and how it came about. As she travels around the world to the most cutting-edge frontiers of researchâ the distant laboratories of Barbados and New Caledonia, the great tit communities of the United Kingdom and the bowerbird habitats of Australia, the ravaged mid-Atlantic coast after Hurricane Sandy and the warming mountains of central Virginia and the western statesâAckerman not only tells the story of the recently uncovered genius of birds but also delves deeply into the latest findings about the bird brain itself that are revolutionizing our view of what it means to be intelligent.Consider, as Ackerman does, the Clarkâs nutcracker, a bird that can hide as many as 30,000 seeds over dozens of square miles and remember where it put them several months later; the mockingbirds and thrashers, species that can store 200 to 2,000 different songs in a brain a thousand times smaller than ours; the well-known pigeon, which knows where itâs going, even thousands of miles from familiar territory; and the New Caledonian crow, an impressive bird that makes its own tools. But beyond highlighting how birds use their unique genius in technical ways, Ackerman points out the impressive social smarts of birds. They deceive and manipulate. They eavesdrop. They display a strong sense of fairness. They give gifts. They play keep-away and tug-of-war. They tease. They share. They cultivate social networks. They vie for status. They kiss to console one another. They teach their young. They blackmail their parents. They alert one another to danger. They summon witnesses to the death of a peer. They may even grieve. This elegant scientific investigation and travelogue weaves personal anecdotes with fascinating science. Ackerman delivers an extraordinary story that will both give readers a new appreciation for the exceptional talents of birds and let them discover what birds can reveal about our changing world. Incredibly informative and beautifully written,Â The Genius of BirdsÂ richly celebrates the triumphs of these surprising and fiercely intelligent creatures. ...more",One,68ef4ec788a342b2917d3b5c,"Birds are astonishingly intelligent creatures.

And yet John Quincy fell in love with her, almost despite himself. Their often tempestuous but deeply close marriage lasted half a century.Â  They lived in Prussia, Massachusetts, Washington, Russia, and England, at royal courts, on farms, in cities, and in the White House. Louisa saw more of Europe and America than nearly any other woman of her time. But wherever she lived, she was always pressing her nose against the glass, not quite sure whether she was looking in or out. The other members of the Adams family could take their identity for grantedâthey were Adamses; they were Americansâbut she had to invent her own. The story of Louisa Catherine Adams is one of a woman who forged a sense of self. As the country her husband led found its place in the world, she found a voice. That voice resonates still.Â  In this deeply felt biography, the talented journalist and historian Louisa Thomas finally gives Louisa Catherine Adams's full extraordinary life its due. An intimate portrait of a remarkable woman, a complicated marriage, and a pivotal historical moment, Louisa Thomas's biography is a masterful work from an elegant storyteller. ...more",Two,68ef4ee688a342b2917d3b75,"An intimate portrait of Louisa Catherine Adams, the wife of John Quincy Adams, who witnessed firsthand the greatest transformations of her time Born in London to an American father and a British mother on the eve of the Revolutionary War, Louisa Catherine Johnson was raised in circumstances very different from the New England upbringing of the future president John Quincy An intimate portrait of Louisa Catherine Adams, the wife of John Quincy Adams, who witnessed firsthand the greatest transformations of her timeÂ Â Â  Born in London to an American father and a British mother on the eve of the Revolutionary War, Louisa Catherine Johnson was raised in circumstances very different from the New England upbringing of the future president John Quincy Adams, whose life had been dedicated to public service from the earliest age.

Just as a soldier would never go into battle alone and unarmed, we must remember that though our struggle is not against flesh and blood (Ephesians 6:12), itâs still a battle. Itâs important to make sure we have other soldiers around us and we are armed with the Sword of the Spirit.

Pink (author of To Sell Is Human: The Surprising Truth About Motivating Others) explains in his paradigm-shattering book Drive, the secret to high performance and satisfaction in today's world is the deeply human need to direct our own lives, to learn and create new things, and to do better by ourselves and our world.Drawing on four decades of scientific research on human motivation, Pink exposes the mismatch between what science knows and what business doesâand how that affects every aspect of our lives. He demonstrates that while the old-fashioned carrot-and-stick approach worked successfully in the 20th century, it's precisely the wrong way to motivate people for today's challenges. In Drive, he reveals the three elements of true motivation:*Autonomyâthe desire to direct our own lives*Masteryâthe urge to get better and better at something that matters*Purposeâthe yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselvesAlong the way, he takes us to companies that are enlisting new approaches to motivation and introduces us to the scientists and entrepreneurs who are pointing a bold way forward.Drive is bursting with big ideasâthe rare book that will change how you think and transform how you live. ...more",Four,68ef4ef388a342b2917d3b83,"Forget everything you thought you knew about how to motivate peopleâat work, at school, at home.
